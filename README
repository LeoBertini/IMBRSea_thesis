DESCRIPTION OF APPENDICES:

01 - Vertical interpolation code for transforming isopycnal fields into depth fields. 
02 - Routine to obtain the annual average for Biogeochemical fields (Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Omega calcite, POCexport).
03 - Filtering routine to remove unusual spikes along the time-series while preserving meaningful fluctuations.
04 - Routine to obtain the annual average for Physical fields (Temperature and Salinity).
05 - Calculation of Aparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) 
06 - Time scale analyses of Maxchange, Time of Departure (ToD) and Time of Recovery (Trec)
07 - Statistical analyses comparing the Pre-Industrial against 30-yr windowns: 1) end of the Mitigation phase (years 250-280), 2) the middle of the Extension phase (years 350-380) and 3) end of the Extension phase (years 450-480)
08 - Vertical profiles of Time scales across the entire NAtl (0-65N)
09 - Time-evolution of biogeochemical drivers at depth for the entire NAtl (0-65N)
10 - Meridional sections for Maxchange and Time-scales (ToD and Trec) 
11 - High resolution images for NAtl meridional sections of Maxhchange 
12 - High resolution images for NAtl meridional sections of Trec
