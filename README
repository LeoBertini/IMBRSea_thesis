DESCRIPTION OF APPENDICES:

01 - Vertical interpolation code for transforming isopycnal fields into depth fields. 
02 - Routine to obtain the annual average for Biogeochemical fields (Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Omega calcite, POCexport).
03 - Filtering routine to remove unusual spikes along the time-series while preserving meaningful fluctuations.
04 - Routine to obtain the annual average for Physical fields (Temperature and Salinity).
05 - Calculation of Aparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) 
06 - Time scale analyses of Maxchange, Time of Departure (ToD) and Time of Recovery (Trec)
07 - Statistical analyses comparing the Pre-Industrial against 30-yr windowns: 1) end of the Mitigation phase (years 250-280), 2) the middle of the Extension phase (years 350-380) and 3) end of the Extension phase (years 450-480)
08 - Vertical profiles of Time scales across the entire NAtl (0-65N)
09 - Time-evolution of biogeochemical drivers at depth for the entire NAtl (0-65N)
10 - Meridional sections for Maxchange and Time-scales (ToD and Trec) 
11 - High resolution images for NAtl meridional sections of Maxhchange 
12 - High resolution images for NAtl meridional sections of Trec

DESCRIPTION OF POST-PROCESSED DATA

##############Statistical Results##############
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o62Zr4Tw-npM6_kNsQUzc2U5cDyGH1_T?usp=sharing

Contains percentage change and the statistical comparisson  results between Pre-Industrial and: 
1) years 250-280; 
2) years 350-380 and 
3) years 350-380

Files are for each variable : pH, AOU, o2sat (oxygen saturation), o2 (dissolved oxygen), omegac( Calcite Saturation State), templvl (temperature), epc100 (POCexport)


##############Time scale analyses ##############
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M0vbH0hiiDIqOshxMqmSYp9oZ_Sb1Sd9?usp=sharing

Contains Time scale estimates for Time of Departure (ToD), Time of Recovery (Trec) and extent of change (Maxchange) 
for different prescribed envelopes of 1 standard deviation, 2 standard diviations and 3 standard deviations. 

Obs. Trec estimates are based on a linear regression using the last 100 years of the time series whenever there is no recovery whitin the time span 
of the simulation.
