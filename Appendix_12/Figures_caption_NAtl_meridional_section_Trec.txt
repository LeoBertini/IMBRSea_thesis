CAPTION:

North Atlantic layers at 500, 1000 and 2000 m deep and meridional section of Time of Recovery (Trec in years since start of the simulation) based on an envelope of 2 standard deviations for 

17.1) Temperature (T) , 
17.2) pH, 
17.3) Dissolved Oxygen (DO) , 
17.4) Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) and 
17.5) Calcite saturation state (Î©c) .

The white contour lines also show the model year in which the time series retuned to the envelope. 
Brown-shaded areas indicate recovery outside the time span of the simulation, where recovery estimates were calculated using 
a linear regression based on the last 100 years of the time series.
